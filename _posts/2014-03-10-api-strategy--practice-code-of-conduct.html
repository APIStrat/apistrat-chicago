When <a href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a> and <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>  first planned API Strategy &amp; Practice, we envisioned an event where everyone is welcome to come and talk about their companys API strategy and tell stories from the trenches about how they are putting APIs to use. We want to create a forum where anyone of any skill level can come and listen to these stories, in an inclusive environment where they wont be listening to sales pitches, or made to feel stupid for what they dont know, in an environment where they are free from harassment.

All the past API Strategy &amp; Practice events have been very open, inclusive conversations and we want to make sure it stays this way. Today we are publishing a <a href="/2014Amsterdam/code-of-conduct.php">code of code</a> to make sure we set a healthy bar for what is expected from everyone participating in the conversation, which includes:
<ul class="mainlist">
	<li>Statement of Unacceptable Behavior</li>
	<li>How We Will Enforce Acceptable Conduct</li>
	<li>How And Where You Can Report Unacceptable Behavior</li>
</ul>
We are making sure that all of our staff is aware of what is acceptable behavior, and available to address any incidents. Our goal is to make sure you have a safe, worry-free event, where you can learn about APIs and leave #APIStrat feeling empowered.

Thank you for supporting API Strategy &amp; Practice, and for making it the open, inclusive conversation about the API space that it is.

if you have feedback on the code please send it to us - wed love to make it as good a fit for the community as possible!

We look forward to seeing you in Amsterdam!
