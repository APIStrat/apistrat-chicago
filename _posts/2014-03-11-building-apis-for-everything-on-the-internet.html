<p class="p1"><em>This is a guest blog by Pratap Ranade. Currently co-founder of  <a title="Kimonolabs" href="https://www.kimonolabs.com/">KimonoLabs</a>, he was formerly an analyst with McKinsey. </em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">APIs are unlocking real value across industries and sectors. Large corporations and governments are realizing this and investing in scalable API strategies. But, while APIs are being built for large scale services and data repositories, the long tail of the internet lags behind. This long tail of content has significant value, adding real richness to the web. As we transition from active consumers of web data on computer screens to constant, passive users, engaging with the web contextually from connected devices, APIs for the long tail will become even more important. So, how do we API-ify the entire web? We must empower data consumers to create.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>APIs are unlocking immense value through programmable access to data and services</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2">Established digital natives have made API business models work at scale. Salesforce, for example generates half of its $3B in revenue from APIs and Expedia generates 90% of $2B. Newer entrants like Twilio and Stripe are unlocking billions of dollars of value by API-ifying traditional services altogether. Older, established tech players have moved aggressively to capture beachheads in API-land in a frenzy of M&amp;A activity last year, including Intels acquisition of Mashery, Microsoft/ Apiphany and CA technologies/ Layer 7.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Non-tech Fortune 500s like AT&amp;T, Telefonica, Aetna and Sears are also starting to put real investment dollars behind new API strategies. And</span> <span class="s1">beyond the private sector, the U.S. government has embraced APIs, with President Obamas Open Data Executive Order mandating government agencies to make their data machine readable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>But, there are still not enough APIs, and the need is more pressing than ever</strong></p>
<p class="p3">Despite efforts to expose APIs from companies and governments, the long tail of the web remains elusive. The web was designed to be read and interpreted by humans staring at computer screens. But today were seeing this paradigm begin to shift as we engage with the internet constantly, albeit more passively through smartphones, wearables and other connected devices without traditional screens. Smartphones form the tip of the iceberg and already account for 15% of global internet traffic, growing at 150% per year. Newer connected devices like Google glass, Jawbones UP and Samsungs galaxy gear are rapidly beginning to blur the lines between actively browsing the internet and passively engaging with it as part of normal life. For this world of contextually-aware connected devices to really transform how we interact with the web and each other, these devices must be able to tap into the rich long tail of the internet via APIs. There are around 10,000 publicly listed APIs in the programmable web directory and about a billion websites. For a very rough sense of scale, were one thousandth of a percent of the way toward API-ifying the internet.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>We can close the gap by empowering consumers to create APIs</strong></p>
<p class="p3">To effectively close the gap, we must empower data consumers to become API creators. Hackers and data scientists on the leading edge will be the first ones to build the killer apps for next generation devices. In all likelihood, these apps will be powered by more than a mashup of the worlds most popular APIs. Whats going to make these apps interesting is an injection of particular data from the long tail of the internet. Enabling hackers and data scientists to quickly and easily create APIs from web data sources at will, for experimentation and prototyping, is vital. Powerful new services are emerging to meet this need, enabling data consumers to create APIs where they don't exist. Kimono Labs, Temboo and IFTTT  are just a few such services making it easy for developers and non-developers to create and use APIs. Together with API directories like Programmable Web and Mashape, tools like these will enable hackers to tap into the full spectrum of web data to build next generation killer apps.</p>
<p class="p2">So far, visionary leaders in government and large companies have started to demonstrate what open data and APIs can enable at scale. New York City for example, took huge steps under the stewardship of Mayor Bloomberg and Chief Digital Officer Rachel Sterne, with programs like NYC Open Data (exposed 2,000 open data sets and 6 NYC APIs for budget data, traffic data, etc.) Now imagine going a step further and creating a truly smart city built on APIs, opening up a world of possibilities like predictive ambulance routing, hyper efficient water and energy conservation and ultra-fast emergency service response times.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">While the big players have given us a vision of what's possible with APIs, its time for individual actors to now take the leading role in API creation. The benefits of APIs are abundantly clear, and with a properly enabled and inspired hacker community, Im excited for what the future holds.</span></p>
