<img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://apistrat.laneworks.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/speedhack.png" alt="" width="325" align="right" />Calling all API developers and hackers! Weve teamed up with WIP to organize something new just for you: the Developer Track and Speed Hack Challenge, including a special Developer Ticket.

<strong>Developer Track</strong>

We have turned one of our 3 conference tracks into a special Developer Track. Meet and gain insight from key API providers during the dedicated Developer Track, where you can hear great API stories from companies like:
<ul>
	<li>Twilio</li>
	<li>Traitify</li>
	<li>Context.io</li>
	<li>Twitter</li>
	<li>and many more</li>
</ul>
<strong>Developer Tickets</strong>

Also, we are introducting $99 <a href="/2014Chicago/register.php">Developer Tickets</a>, available to developers and Speed Hack participants through August. They include entry to the following:
<ul>
	<li>API Expo Zone</li>
	<li>Developer track sessions</li>
	<li>Some keynotes</li>
	<li>Participation in the Speed Hack Challenge  remember, there is limited space for the challenge, so sign up today!</li>
</ul>
<strong>Speed Hack Challenge</strong>

Finally, we're excited to announce our first ever Speed Hack Challenge. Teams of developers will compete to solve small API challenges within a strict time limit. The team that solves the most challenges in the fastest times will take home $1,500 in grand prize winnings. There will also be additional prizes for the runner-up team!

Stay tuned, we'll have more exciting details for you in the next few weeks. Happy hacking!
