            <div class="mtop10">Teams building successful APIs focus on six tactical best practices areas to gain widespread developer community adoption, increase operational resiliency, accelerate API delivery, and seamlessly evolve API design as business requirements change.  In this session, learn how to make tactical design decisions that expand your internal and external API community, reliably connect back-end Cloud services, rapidly publish data as APIs, secure API interactions, and synchronize lifecycle activities.  Chris and Sumedha will build a few live APIs in the Cloud. The APIs will demonstrate design patterns, implementation decisions, and API environments (cloud and on-premise) that allow you to tailor your API based on target ecosystem and business model.<br /><br />

• How to orchestrate and aggregate back-end Cloud services with an API façade layer.<br />
• Best practices and patterns to employ when designing internal and external APIs.<br />
• Techniques to rapidly publish spreadsheet, relational, and unstructured data using APIs.<br />
• How to synchronize SOA service lifecycle governance and API lifecycle activities.<br />
• API ecosystem decisions underlying secure API interactions and knowing your API’s customer.<br />
• Developer advocacy blocking and tackling, and how to demonstrate API product success.<br /></div>

Learn how to find the data you are looking for, and where the opportunities are for APIs at all level of government. Chicago provides an excellent blueprint for how APIs are moving into the mainstream, and becoming a default part of a cities technical, business and political operations. We’ll spend some time looking through what is available in Chicago, and where the opportunities are for building apps, websites, and even more APIs. </div>
